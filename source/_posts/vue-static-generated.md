- SSR (Server Side Rendered): they're rendered on the server for every request. Sprinter works like that.
- SPA (Single Page Application): client-only javascript based apps. Nowadays, they're quite well-known.
- Static Generated: a.k.a. Jam Stack. Similar to SSR, but the html is rendered at compile time, so they don't need a server while also being SEO friendly.
